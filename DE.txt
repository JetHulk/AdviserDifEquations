First Order DE?
Separable Equation?
Separate x,y to the sides and integrate.


Use Integrating Factor.


Second Order?
Homogenous?
Use Auxiliary Method or if you are given one general solution, use Reduction of Order.


With Constant Coefficients?
Use Annihilator Method.


Use Variation of Parameters method.


Sorry. This program is not programed to solve more complicated DEs.
